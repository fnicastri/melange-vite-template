# melange-vite-template

A simple project template using [Melange](https://github.com/melange-re/melange)
with [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

If you are looking for a template with webpack, check [melange-opam-template](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-opam-template).

If you are looking for a template with esy, check [melange-esy-template](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-esy-template).

## Quick Start

```shell
make init
make dev
```

### React

React support is provided by
[`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/). The entry
point of the sample React app is [`src/ReactApp.re`](src/ReactApp.re).

## Commands

You can see all available commands by running `make help` or just `make`. Here
are a few of the most useful ones:

- `make init`: set up opam local switch and download OCaml, Melange and
JavaScript dependencies
- `make install`: install OCaml, Melange and JavaScript dependencies
- `make dev`: run a development server that watches for changes
- `make serve`: serve a production build with a local HTTP server
- `make bundle`: bundle a production build in the `dist/` directory

## JavaScript output

Since Melange just compiles source files into JavaScript files, it can be used
for projects on any JavaScript platform - not just the browser.

The template includes two `melange.emit` stanza for two separate apps. This
stanza tells Dune to generate JavaScript files using Melange, and specifies in
which folder the JavaScript files should be placed, by leveraging the `target`
field:
- The React app JavaScript files will be placed in `_build/default/src/output/*`.
- The NodeJS app JavaScript files will be placed in `_build/default/src/node/*`.

So for example, [`src/Hello.ml`](src/Hello.ml) (using OCaml syntax) can be run with
`node`:

```bash
node _build/default/src/node/src/Hello.js
```

Similarly, `_build/default/src/output/src/ReactApp.js` can be passed as entry to a bundler
like Webpack:

```bash
webpack --mode production --entry ./_build/default/src/output/src/ReactApp.js
```
